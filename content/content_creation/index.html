# Content Creation

PlayCanvas supports the importing of a wide variety of content types:

* Models (built in most mainstream 3D content creation packages).
* Animations.
* Images.
* Audio samples.

Once imported into your online project, these assets are made available to your project.

The content creation guide shows how to:

* [Build 3D models][build] so that they are PlayCanvas-friendly.
* [Export 3D models][export] from applications like Blender, 3DS Max, Maya and others.
* [Import assets][import] into your online project.
