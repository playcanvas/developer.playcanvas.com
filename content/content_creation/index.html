# Content Creation

PlayCanvas supports the importing of a wide variety of content types:

* Images (PNG, JPG, GIF).
* Models and animations (built in most mainstream 3D content creation packages).
* Audio samples.

Once imported into your online project, the content is made avaiable to your project as assets.

The content creation guide shows how to:

* Install and use the [PlayCanvas Asset Tools][asset_tools].
* [Build content][build] so that it is PlayCanvas-friendly.
* [Preview content][preview] rapidly in the browser before importing it.
* [Import content][import] into your online project.
