# Getting Started

In order to learn the basics of PlayCanvas Platform, let's build the following simple 3D web app:

<iframe id='cube-frame' src="http://apps.playcanvas.com/playcanvas/tutorials/cube?overlay=false"></iframe>

## Your Profile

Once you've signed in you will be greeted with your profile page. Your profile page shows you all the Projects you have access to, this includes all Projects you have created and any that you have been given permission to access.

A Project is a collection of:

* Packs - An collection Entities used to build up a part of your game. A Pack could be a single level or your entire game. It depends 
* Assets - 3D Models, textures, images, sound files and anything other assets you use in your game.
* Code - Your source code, is provided either as a link to a source control repository, such as Git or Mercurial, or a uploaded folder of code.
* Exports and published apps - Your applications can be exported to archives ready to be deployed, or published directly to PlayCanvas servers.

## Creating a New Project

On your profile page, press the add button. This takes you to the 'Create new project' page where you set the details of your new project:

* Name - The name is used to build the URL for your project. For example, if user 'joebloggs' created a project called 'spacewar', the project can be found at http://playcanvas.com/joebloggs/spacewar
* Description - A short description of your project that will appear on the main project page.
* Privacy - The project visibility. By default, new projects are private (only visible to yourself) but deselecting this option allows others to browse the project.

On confirming the new project details, you are taken to the project home page.

## Adding Collaborators

![Collaborators][collaborators]

PlayCanvas is all about collaborative development. Once you have a new project, you can start adding additional team members and give them access rights. From the project home page, select 'Settings'. Under the Collaborators section you can add new team members, enter the e-mail address they use to access PlayCanvas Platform and select the access level you wish to give them. The access levels are:

* Read - The collaborator can load, run and export the contents of the project.
* Write - In addition to read privileges, the collaborator can edit and save to the project.
* Administrator - In addition to write privileges, the collaborator can modify the settings of the project.

Once you have assigned a permission, select 'Add' and the project will be added to the list of projects on the new collaborator's profile page.

## A Simple Example: Spinning Cube

Now we're ready to build a simple 3D web app: a spinning cube!

The first thing to do is create a new pack. A pack represents the data required to bootstrap the PlayCanvas engine. It could represent an entire game or perhaps a single level of a game. It's up to you, but you will require at least one pack. Therefore, on the project home page select the 'packs' tab and then select 'New Pack' at the bottom of the pack lister. This opens a new browser tab and fires up the visual editor: PlayCanvas Designer.

### Packs, Entities and Components

A PlayCanvas Pack is effectively a collection of 'things' that make up your app. We call these things Entities and they represent the functional objects in your app: a vehicle, a character, a light, a camera, etc. Entities are shown in the 'Pack Explorer' panel in Designer's interface. It's represented by a tree control because entities are hierarchical. You can parent one to another and if the parent moves, the children move with it.

![Pack Explorer][pack_explorer]

Entities are built from Components. A Component powers an Entity with a particular piece of functionality. For example, a Component can add a graphical model to an Entity, it can animate the model, it can add a light source to an Entity, it can add an audio source, and so the list goes on.

For our spinning cube experiment, we will need 3 Entities:

* A cube.
* A camera (to view the cube).
* A light (to give some definition to the cube).

Here are the steps to create the cube:

* Select the root node 'Untitled' in the Pack Explorer.
* In the Attribute Editor below the Pack Explorer, rename the Untitled root node to something more meaningful such as 'Cube Test'.
* Select 'New Entity' from the 'Entity' menu. This creates a new child entity of 'Cube Test' in the Pack Explorer.
* Select the new entity (called 'Untitled') in the Pack Explorer.
* In the Attribute Editor, change the 'Name' field to 'Cube'.
* Select 'Add Component' from the 'Entity' menu.
* Select 'primitive' from the list and hit OK. This creates a 1x1x1 unit box primitive at the location of the entity (the world space origin).

Now let's create the camera:

* Select the root node 'Cube Test' in the Pack Explorer.
* In the 'Entity' menu, expand the 'New ...' submenu and select 'New Camera'. This creates a new child camera entity of 'Cube Test' in the Pack Explorer.
* Select the new camera entity in the Pack Explorer to activate the Attribute Editor.
* In the Attribute Editor, set 'Position:' to 0, 0, 5.

Finally, let's create the light:

* Select the root node 'Cube Test' in the Pack Explorer.
* In the 'Entity' menu, expand the 'New ...' submenu and select 'New Directional Light'. This creates a new child Entity of 'Cube Test' in the Pack Explorer with a Directional Light Component added to it.
* Select the new entity called 'Directional Light' in the Pack Explorer. This activates the Attribute Editor, allowing you to edit the entity.
* In the Attribute Editor, set 'Rotation:' to 45, -30, 0 to reorient the light.

You should now have someone similar to the following in the 3D View:

<img alt="Cube in 3D View" width="640" src="/media/images/platform/designer_cube.jpg"></img>

### Save your work

Now would seem to be a good time to save your work, right? In actual fact, PlayCanvas Designer continually updates your project on the server and therefore there is no need for a save button. Your work is preserved should you decided to close the Designer tab at any point.

### Previewing Your Work

From Designer, you can quickly preview your work at any time. To do this, press either the 'Launch' or 'Launch Local' button (more on these later) on the toolbar. 

![Launch Buttons][launch_buttons]

This will open a new tab and fire up your embryonic web app. Based on the steps above, you should see something similar to what is shown below:

<img alt="Cube in engine" width="640" src="/media/images/platform/designer_cube_preview.jpg"></img>

Once you are done with previewing your pack, you can switch back to Designer and stop your application (the Launch option will display a Stop icon while the app is running).

### Scripting Entities

So far, we've managed to render a cube. Now, let's animate it.

The real power and versatility of PlayCanvas comes from the ability to assign scripted behaviour to individual entities. This is done by assigning a script component to an entity and then specifying the Javascript file that executes in relation to that entity. In order to get the cube to spin, we need to write some code that executes every frame, rotating the cube on its vertical axis by a small amount at a time.

Open your editor of choice and add the following to a file called 'spinner.js':

~~~javascript~~~
pc.script.create("spinner", function (context) {

    var Spinner = function (entity) {
        // Cache the entity that this script instance affects
        this.entity = entity;
    };

    Spinner.prototype = {
        update: function (dt) {
            // Rotate 90 degrees around the world Y axis every second
            this.entity.rotate(0, 90 * dt, 0);
        }
    };

    return Spinner;
});
~~~~~~~

Once assigned, this script will cause any Entity to rotate around the world space Y axis about its local origin. But how do you assign your spinner.js script to the cube Entity? Simply follow these steps:

* Select the entity called 'Cube' in the Pack Explorer.
* Select 'Add Component' from the 'Component' menu.
* Select 'script' from the list and hit OK.
* In the Attribute Editor, set the URL attribute of the script component to 'spinner.js'.

If you were to run the pack now using the 'Launch Local' option the browser will attempt to read the script from `http://localhost:51000/spinner.js`. Running scripts from a web server running locally allows you to edit, save and reload your PlayCanvas web app quickly, speeding up development. You can find a script for running a Local Server for your code on our [Script Workflow page](/engine/workflow.html). Alternatively, once you've set up a Code Repository, you can use the other 'Launch' command and that will load from code stored on the PlayCanvas servers.

Remember, the server must be started from the same location as spinner.js.

With that done, you can select the Launch button from the toolbar once again. This time, you should see your cube rotating on the spot. Congratulations, you have built your first PlayCanvas app!
