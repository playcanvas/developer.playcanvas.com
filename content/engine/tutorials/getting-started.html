# Getting Started 

Getting up and running with the PlayCanvas runtime couldn't be simpler. Here we go:

## Supported Web Browsers

* [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) 12 or greater. Supported OSs: Windows, Max OS X, Linux, Chrome OS.
* [Firefox 4](http://www.mozilla.com) or greater. Supported OSs: Windows, Max OS X, Linux, Android.
* Internet Explorer 6+ (via Google Chrome Frame). Supported OSs: Windows.
* Safari 5.1+. Supported OSs: Max OS X.

Ensure that you have the latest driver for your graphics card. 
Check by visiting [AMD](http://amd.com) or [NVIDEA](http://nvidia.com) (or the web site of your card manufacturer). 
If your graphics card driver is deemed 'too old' by Chrome, 3D rendering will be disabled. 
You can check this status by visiting the URL about:gpu in Google Chrome and verifying the line: 'WebGL: Hardware accelerated'.

## 1. Set up a local webserver

This is the scariest part of the getting started process, but don't worry it's very simple really. 
In order to run javascript code you need to serve your game from a webserver, and the best way to do that is to run one on the machine you are developing on. 
Though installing [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) isn't that difficult it's even easier to use a pre-canned solution. 
We recommend [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html), which makes running a local webserver as simple as double clicking on the application. 
Plus it works on Windows, OS X and Linux.

Note, we're only concerned about the Apache part of XAMPP, you don't need to worry about MySQL or PHP.

Once you've installed your local webserver you need to find out which directory it runs from usually this is called 'ht_docs' or 'htdocs' and lives in the directory that XAMPP is installed into. You will probably want to create a sub-directory in this folder for each of your projects. So for this tutorial create a directory called 'getting-started' in you web server root directory. From now on we'll assume that all the files we create are added to this directory. Alternatively if you're feeling clever you can change the directory that XAMPP serves, open up the httpd.conf file and rename any reference to the 'ht_docs'/'htdocs' path to a new directory of your choosing.

## 2. Download the PlayCanvas Runtime
The runtime code for a PlayCanvas game is available as a single javascript file from the Downloads section of our developer website. 
Download the latest version and save it into your 'getting-started' directory.

## 3. Create index.html
Many websites start with an index.html file and a PlayCanvas game is very much like a normal website. 
Using your favourite text editor create a file called index.html and add this HTML to it.

Just remember to set the correct filename of the playcanvas file you've downloaded.

## 4. Write some code

Now we can start to write some code against the PlayCanvas API. 
Heres something simple to get started. All this code will do is get a hold of the canvas element and clear it to a nice orange color.

Put this script tag after the canvas tag in your index.html file.

~~~html~~~
<script type="text/javascript">
    var canvas;
    var graphicsDevice

    function render() {
        // Begin rendering the frame
        graphicsDevice.updateBegin();

        // Clear the frame buffer
        graphicsDevice.clear({
            color: [1.0, 0.6, 0.0, 1],
            flags: pc.gfx.ClearFlag.COLOR
        });

        // Finish rendering the frame
        graphicsDevice.updateEnd();

        // Submit a request to queue up a new animation frame immediately
        requestAnimFrame(render, canvas);
    }

    function main() {
        // Retrieve the canvas element
        canvas = document.getElementById("sample_canvas");

        // Open the log
        Log.open();

        // Create the graphics device
        graphicsDevice = new pc.gfx.Device(canvas);
        graphicsDevice.setCurrent();

        // Start the render loop
        render();
    }
    main();
</script>

## 5. Load the page
Now all you have to do is load the page in your browser. For the default settings for XAMPP this means loading up http://localhost/getting-started/ in your web browser.

That's it, you've created your first PlayCanvas application.

Here's the demo running below:

<canvas id="sample_canvas" width="600" height="480"></canvas>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/media/js/tutorials/getting-started/sample.js"></script>
