When you are building your game with PlayCanvas, you will probably want to use 3D models and animations to make it look and play great! The Asset Library is a growing repository of free content that you can import into your game with a single click.

## Accessing the Asset Library

The Asset Library can be opened from PlayCanvas Designer. Just hit the big orange button in the top right of the interface:

<img alt="Asset Library Button" src="/images/platform/asset_library/asset_library_button.png" />

The Asset Library opens in a dialog that shows the thumbnails of all assets that can be imported into your project:

<img alt="Asset Library" width="640" src="/images/platform/asset_library/asset_library_open.png" />

Choose an asset and hit the 'Add' button. Note that assets can only be imported into a project once, after which the 'Add' button becomes greyed out.

The import process will take a few seconds (depending on how large the asset is). Once the process is complete, a new Model Entity will be created as a child of your scene's root Entity with the asset assigned. The new Entity will inherit the name of the asset.

Here's a video showing the process in action:

## Finding More Assets

Assets in the Asset Library are grouped by provider. To find more assets to use in your games, follow the link back to each provider's web site.
