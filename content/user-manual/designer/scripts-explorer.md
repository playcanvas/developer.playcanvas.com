![Scripts Explorer](/images/platform/scripts_explorer.png "Drag & drop scripts from the Scripts Explorer on Script Components")

The Scripts Explorer shows you a tree view of the Scripts that you have in your Code Repository. If you want to add a script on an
Entity, simply drag and drop a script from the Scripts Explorer on the Script Component of the Entity.

If you want to view or edit the code in one of your scripts, simply click on a script in the Scripts Explorer and that will open the Code Editor.

To refresh the scripts shown in the treeview click on the Refresh button on the top right of the Scripts Explorer.
