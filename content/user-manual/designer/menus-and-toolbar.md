![Menubar](/images/platform/menu_bar.png "The menu bar contains all the commands!")

Just like a standard desktop application, the menubar contains a complete list of all the commands that you can perform on your pack. All Designer commands should be available via a menu option.

The Toolbar features common commands for easy access, the most useful one of all is the Launch Button. The Launch Button starts a game instance in a separate browser tab and loads your Pack. You can then start play testing immediately. See the section on the Attribute Editor for how to edit values on a live running instance of your game.
