3D models and animations are imported into PlayCanvas by uploading scene files from a [3D modeling application][modeling] such as [Blender][blender], 3D Studio Max or Maya.

PlayCanvas supports a wide variety of formats, such as FBX, COLLADA and obj. We recommend using the FBX format for best results.

Uploading one of these files will create a [Source Asset][source_asset] of type 'scene' and will produce a [Target Asset](target_asset) of type 'model'. You will use the target 'model' in your game.
