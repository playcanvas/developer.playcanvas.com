An Animation asset is used to play a single animation on a 3D model. Animations are imported by uploading 3D scenes (such as FBX files) which contain animation data. The animation data is extracted from the uploaded file by the [asset pipeline][asset_pipeline] and a [Target Asset][target_asset] is created to use in game.
