In photography and optics, vignettings is a reduction of an image's brightness or saturation at the periphery compared to the image center. You can use it to draw attention to the center of the frame. <small>(from [Wikipedia][wikipedia])</small>

Here is an image without the effect:

<img alt="Image without effect" src="/images/platform/posteffects/without_effects.png"></img>

and the same image with the effect applied:

<img alt="Image with effect" src="/images/platform/posteffects/with_vignette.png"></img>

The built-in vignette effect has the following attributes:

* **Offset**: Controls the offset of the effect.
* **Darkness**: Controls the darkness of the effect.
