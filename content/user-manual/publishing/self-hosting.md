If you don't want to host your game on [playcanvas.com][playcanvas], then you are free to download it in its entirety and place it wherever you like. To do this, follow these steps:

* In your project dashboard, select the 'Designer' tab.
* Check the pack that you want to export.
* Click the 'Export' button at the top right of the pack lister.
* Select the 'Exports' tab. You should see your exported pack. The generation of the export may not be complete when you view the Exports page. After all, the server has to do some work to generate your download for you. If the download link has not yet appeared, refresh the page until it is visible.
* Click download and your ZIP will be downloaded to your hard drive.
* Extract the contents wherever you like and point a browser at the contained index.html. You PlayCanvas web app will load.
