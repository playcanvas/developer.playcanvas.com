The Project Dashboard is the control centre for your project. From the dashboard you can view all the Packs you've created; you can upload and manage your assets and your asset importing pipeline. The project dashboard displays your code directory, either your PlayCanvas directory or your synced repository from a service like [Github](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/). Finally, you can also publish your game live to the web, or export it to a zip file and download it.
