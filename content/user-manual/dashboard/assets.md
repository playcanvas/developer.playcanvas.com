![Dashboard](/images/platform/dashboard_assets.png)

The Asset dashboard lists all the Assets that are in your Project.

## Uploading Assets

You can upload assets by dropping files on the dashboard, or by clicking the New Asset button.

## Source Assets and Target Assets

By default only Source Assets are shown in dashboard. You can use the filter to show and hide Target Assets too.

When you delete a Source Asset, all Target Assets created from the Source Asset will be deleted as well.

There is full explanation about the difference between Source and Target assets in [this section][1]
