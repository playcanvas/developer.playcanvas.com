# Basic Keyboard Input

*Click to focus, then press `left arrow` and `right arrow` to speed up and slow down rotation, press and hold `spacebar` to change the color*

Keyboard handling in the PlayCanvas engine is provided by the `pc.input.Keyboard` object. The Keyboard object provides a simple interface
for common keyboard operations like checking if a key is pressed or held down. It also takes away the various cross-browser problems with 
handling keycodes and charcodes. 

Take a look at the input_keyboard Pack in the [tutorials depot][depot]. Here is the code for the tutorial:

~~~javascript~~~
pc.script.create("keyboard_handler", function (context) {
    var KeyboardHandler = function (entity) {
        this.entity = entity;
        
        this.angle = 0;
        this.spinRate = 0;
        this.up = pc.math.vec3.create(0,1,0);
    };
    
    KeyboardHandler.prototype.update = function (dt) {
        /*
         * Notice in the demo that pressing and holding the arrow keys doesn't 
         * make the block spin faster. wasPressed() is used to detect a 
         * keypress that occurred since the last frame and will only be 
         * called once even if the key is held down.
         */
        if (context.keyboard.wasPressed(pc.input.KEY_LEFT)) {
            this.spinRate -= 0.5;
        } else if (context.keyboard.wasPressed(pc.input.KEY_RIGHT)) {
            this.spinRate += 0.5;            
        } 
        
        /*
         * Notice that pressing and holding the space bar makes the block 
         * continuously change color. isPressed() is used to detected if a
         * key is down right now. So it will be true every frame as long as 
         * the key is still pressed.
         */
        if (context.keyboard.isPressed(pc.input.KEY_SPACE)) {
            var color = context.systems.primitive.get(this.entity, "color");
            color -= 0xff;
            context.systems.primitive.set(this.entity, "color", color);
        }
        
        // Update the spinning cube
        this.angle = this.angle + this.spinRate * dt;
        var rotate = pc.math.mat4.makeRotate(this.angle, this.up);
        this.entity.setLocalTransform(rotate);
    };
    
    return KeyboardHandler;
});

The two `if` statements in the main update loop demonstrate the different methods to testing for key presses.

### `isPressed(key)`

`isPressed(key)` checks to see if `key` is currently pressed and returns true if it is. It will return true for every frame while the key is pressed.

### `wasPressed(key)`

`wasPressed(key)` checks to see if `key` was pressed *since the last frame*. `wasPressed()` will only return true once for a single key press.

### Try it out

Try it out in full screen [here][tutorial] or at the top of the page. Compare tapping and holding the arrow keys, and tapping and holding the spacebar.
