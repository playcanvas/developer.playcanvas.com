PlayCanvas games are just web pages. An index.html file and a collection of resources (JavaScript files, JSON files, images and so on). They work great in web browsers, of course, but if you want to submit your game to a mobile app store such as Google Play or the Apple App Store, then you somehow need to convert your PlayCanvas game to a native app. There are 3 options for this:

* [Intel XDK][1]
* [Ludei's CocoonJS][2]
* [PlayCanvas iOS Xcode project downloader][3]
