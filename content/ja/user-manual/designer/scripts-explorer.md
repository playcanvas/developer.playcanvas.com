![Scripts Explorer][1]

The Scripts Explorer shows you a tree-view of the Scripts that you have in your Code Repository. If you want to add a script on an
Entity, simply drag and drop a script from the Scripts Explorer on the Script Component of the Entity.

If you want to view or edit the code in one of your scripts, simply click on a script in the Scripts Explorer and that will open the Code Editor.

To refresh the scripts shown in the tree-view click on the Refresh button on the top right of the Scripts Explorer.
