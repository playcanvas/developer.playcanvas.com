## How do I create a shape like a box, sphere etc?

You can add primitive shapes like boxes, spheres and others by adding a **Model Component** on an Entity and changing its type to the desired shape.

You can also right click on an Entity and select New Entity/Box to add a box (similarly for other shapes).
