## How do I play a sound?

To play sounds you need to add an <a href="http://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/packs/components/audiosource/" target="_blank">AudioSource</a> component to an Entity and drag <a href="http://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/assets/audio/" target="_blank">Audio assets</a> on the Assets field. In order to hear the sounds you also need to add an <a href="http://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/packs/components/audiolistener/" target="_blank">AudioListener</a> component to an Entity - usually to the Camera Entity.

You can create Audio assets by dragging audio files from your computer into the Assets panel.
