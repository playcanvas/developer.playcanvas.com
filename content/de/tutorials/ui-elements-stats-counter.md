*How to use buttons, progress bars and interact with elements. See the [full scene][1].*

In this tutorial we are going to use the built-in [Elements][2] to create a few simple widgets that allow you to increase a stat by clicking on plus / minus buttons.

For each stat we need a minus button, a plus button, a progress bar and some text to show the current stat value.

## Hierarchy

This is what our UI looks like in the Hierarchy:

![Hierarchy][4]

## Screen setup

First we start by adding a new 2D [Screen][3]. This is what our Screen looks like:

![Screen][5]

Since it's a 2D screen we have ticked Screen Space. Our Reference Resolution is the resolution that we are targeting - in this case it's 1080 x 1920. We choose Blend for Scale Mode so that our Screen adapts to resolution changes and we set Scale Blend to 1 so that the Screen will adapt only to height changes.

## Stats setup

For each stat we will create a different Group Element. This allows us to treat sub-elements of the Group to be anchored to the Group edges and allows us to treat each stat as a separate widget.

We will only examine the Boost stat - the others are exactly the same. This is that the `stats-boost` Entity looks like in the viewport:

![Boost][6]

And these are its attributes:

![Boost Attributes][7]

As you can see it has a Group Element component with the appropriate size to contain all our elements and it's anchored to the bottom of the screen. It also has a Script Component with the script `uiStats` assigned to it. This script will allow us to handle interactions with the Elements of the group.

This is what our group looks like in the Hierarchy:

![Boost Hierarchy][8]

Our group has the following child Elements:

* `text-title`: A Text Element for the title of the group - anchored to the top of the group.
* `btn-minus`: An Image Element that has a child Text Element. This is our minus button and it's anchored to the bottom left of the group.
* `btn-plus`: An Image Element that has a child Text Element. This is our plus button and it's anchored to the bottom right of the group.
* `progress-bar`: Our progress bar anchored to the bottom of the Group. This is an Image Element for the background of the progress bar and it has 2 child Elements:
    * `image-progress`: The resizable Image Element that actually displays progress. Anchored to the left of the `progress-bar` Element.
    * `text`: The Text Element that displays our stats. Anchored to the center of the `progress-bar` Element.

## Scripts

We have a script on each button to allow us to change their texture based on hover states. This is similar to the script found in [this tutorial][9]. We also have a script to handle our progress bar. There is more info on progress bars in [this tutorial][10].

The main script that handles the interactions for each stat is `uiStats`:

```javascript
var UiStats = pc.createScript('uiStats');

UiStats.prototype.initialize = function() {
    // find our widgets
    this.btnPlus = this.entity.findByName('btn-plus');
    this.btnMinus = this.entity.findByName('btn-minus');
    this.progressBar = this.entity.findByName('progress-bar');
    this.progressText = this.progressBar.findByName('text');

    // initialize value to 0
    this.setValue(0);

    // increase value with plus button
    this.btnPlus.element.on('click', function (evt) {
        this.setValue(this.value + 1);
    }, this);

    // decrease value with minus button
    this.btnMinus.element.on('click', function (evt) {
        this.setValue(this.value - 1);
    }, this);
};

// Sets the stat value
UiStats.prototype.setValue = function (value) {
    // clamp between min and max
    this.value = pc.math.clamp(value, 0, 10);
    // set progress
    this.progressBar.script.progressBar.setProgress(this.value / 10);
    // update progress text
    this.progressText.element.text = this.value + ' / ' + 10;
};
```

In this script we find our child elements and when the plus or minus buttons are clicked we increase / decrease the stat and update the progress bar and its text.
