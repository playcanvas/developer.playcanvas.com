PlayCanvas incorporates an advanced graphics engine. Internally it uses the WebGL API to draw graphical primitives to the screen.

Some of its key features are as follows:

* Physically based rendering (PBR)
* Directional, point and spot lights (all of which can cast shadows)
* Static and skinned mesh rendering
* GPU particle engine
* Post effect library
