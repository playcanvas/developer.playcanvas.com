The settings dashboard lets you set up Project settings.

## Project Settings

#### Name and Description

You can update the description of your project here. Currently it is not possible to change the name.

#### Project Image

Assign a square 720x720 image to go along with your project. This image is also used to represent any published games from this project. And it will appear on social sites like Twitter and Facebook if users share your game.

If you want your project to be featured on playcanvas.com, you must add a project image.

#### Private

Private projects are only visible to users who have been explicitly assigned read, write or admin access.
