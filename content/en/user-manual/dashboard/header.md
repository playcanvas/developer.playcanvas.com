The Dashboard Header provides various buttons to quickly perform common actions for a project.

By clicking on the EDITOR button you can open up the PlayCanvas Editor and also manage your scenes.

![Editor][2]

You can click on a scene to open it up and you can click on the buttons on the right of each scene to play a scene, duplicate it or delete it. You can also click on the banner icon on the left of each scene to make it the Primary Scene. The Primary Scene is the first scene loaded when you publish an app or when you export your project. Think of it as the first 'level' in your application.

By clicking on the PLAY button you can play the Primary App of this project. By clicking on the FORK button you can fork this project, which means that a clone of this project will be copied to your account.
