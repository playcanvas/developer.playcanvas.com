You can create new assets by dragging a file from you computer into the assets panel. We will upload and import the asset for you. You can also create new Materials and Cubemaps using the Add Asset icon.

You can delete assets by selecting them and clicking the Delete Asset icon.

## Filtering

Filter which assets are visible using the filter drop down to select the type of asset to view. You can also search for assets by name using the search box.
