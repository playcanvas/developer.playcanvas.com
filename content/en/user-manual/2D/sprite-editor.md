## Viewport

![Viewport][2]

The viewport in the Sprite Editor shows the currently selected Texture Atlas. Frames are shown as grey boxes on the texture atlas. The currently selected asset is shown with two sets of handles. green and blue. Green handles modify the frame's width and height, blue handles modify the frame's border property.

### Editing Texture Atlases

Within the viewport use the mouse to drag the outline of a Frame, then use the green and blue handles to modify the frames extents and borders.

#### Frames

Frames are a defined region on a Texture Atlas. A frame has a name, a position and size and a border. The border is used to define the edges of the 9-slicing region. See the [9-slicing documentation][7] for more information.

## Inspector

The inspector panel shows the properties of the currently selected item. The inspector changes depending on whether the selected item is a Texture Atlas, Frame or Sprite Asset.

### Texture Atlas Inspector

![Texture Atlas Inspector][3]

The Texture Atlas Inspector allows you to automatically slice a texture atlas into a fixed grid.

First choose what to do with existing frames. You can choose to *Delete Existing* frames or do not delete and *Only Append* frames.

Then select the method of specifying the grid cells

* Grid By Frame Count - Specify the number of grid cells horizontally and vertically to divide the texture into
* Grid By Frame Size - Specify the size in pixels that each grid cell should be

Then set the values for Offset and Spacing. Offset is the number of pixels to move in from the top left of the texture before starting the grid. Spacing is the number of pixels between each grid cell.

Finally set the pivot for all newly generated frames, the pivot determines the position and rotation point of the sprite. It is specified as a proportion of the width and height.

Once all your settings are chose, click the **Generate Frames** button to create your frames.

### Frame Inspector

![Frame Inspector][4]

The Frame Inspector lets you set the properties for an individual frame or group of frames. It is visible when you select one or more Frames. The Frame Inspector is also where you create a new Sprite from.

The Inspector lets you modify the Position, Size and Border properties of the frame.
