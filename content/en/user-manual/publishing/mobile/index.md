PlayCanvas games are just web pages. An index.html file and a collection of resources (JavaScript files, JSON files, images and so on). They work great in web browsers, of course, but if you want to submit your game to a mobile app store such as Google Play or the Apple App Store, then you somehow need to convert your PlayCanvas game to a native app. There are a few products available to simplify the process for you:

* [Cordova][1]
* [PhoneGap][2]

Alternatively, another option is to create an Android or iOS app the consists of a single fullscreen WebView that loads your PlayCanvas app from local app resources.
