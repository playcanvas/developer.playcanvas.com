## How do I render a 3D model?

<img src="https://playcanvas.com/static-assets/instructions/new_model.gif"/>

To render a 3D model you need to add a **Model Component** to an Entity and drag a **Model Asset** on the Asset field. Alternatively you can drag and drop a Model Asset from the Assets Panel into the 3D Viewport.
