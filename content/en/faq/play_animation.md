## How do I play an animation?

To play an animation of a 3D model you need to create an Entity with a <a href="http://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/packs/components/model/" target="_blank">Model Component</a> and an <a href="http://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/packs/components/animation/" target="_blank">Animation Component</a>. The **Model Component** will render your model and the **Animation Component** will play animations.

To render the model drag a model Asset in the Asset field of the Model Component. To play animations drag Animation Assets on the Assets field of the Animation Component.
