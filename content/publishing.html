# Publishing Your PlayCanvas App

Once you have built your web app, you will no doubt want to publish out to the web and allow people to enjoy its majesty! PlayCanvas makes things very easy for you. You have a choice in how you do this:

1. **Export** your web app to a ZIP file which can be downloaded and then extracted to the web server of your choosing.
2. **Publish** your web app to http://apps.playcanvas.com/.

Let's take each of these in turn.

## Exporting

If you don't want to host your web app on playcanvas.com, then you are free to download it in its entirety and place it wherever you like. To do this, follow these steps:

* In your depot dashboard, select the 'Packs' tab.
* Check the pack that you want to export.
* Click the 'Export' button at the bottom of the pack lister.
* Select the 'Exports' tab. You should see your exported pack. The generation of the export may not be complete when you view the Exports page. After all, the server has to do some work to generate your download for you. If the download link has not yet appeared, refresh the page until it is visible.
* Click download and your ZIP will be downloaded to your hard drive.
* Extract the contents wherever you like and point a browser at the contained index.html. You PlayCanvas web app will load.

## Publishing on apps.playcanvas.com

Although you have complete flexibility if you download your exported web app, it is less convenient and immediate than simply publishing it on apps.playcanvas.com. To publish in this way, follow these steps:

* In your depot dashboard, select the 'Packs' tab.
* Check the pack that you want to export.
* Click the 'Export' button at the bottom of the pack lister.
* Select the 'Exports' tab. You should see your exported pack.
* Check the newly exported pack.
* Click the 'Publish' button at the bottom of the exports lister.
* A dialog will ask you for a name for the published app. This is used to construct the URL in the form http://apps.playcanvas.com/<YOU_PLAYCANVAS_USERNAME>/<YOUR_DEPOT_NAME>/<PUBLISH_NAME>. So for example, if PlayCanvas user 'will' had a depot called 'callofhonor' and chose a publish name of 'megawar', the published URL would be http://apps.playcanvas.com/will/callofhonor/megawar. Enter a name and click 'OK'.
* Your web app is now live!
