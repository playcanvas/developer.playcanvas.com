# Glossary

Here is an overview of some of the terms we use to describe the PlayCanvas Engine and Tools.

<h3 id="app_context">ApplicationContext</h3>
The `pc.fw.ApplicationContext` class is where all the useful engine stuff that your application needs to run is store. It stores, the scene graph hierarchy, the Component Systems and the 
keyboard and mouse handlers. The ApplicationContext is made available to all user scripts by being passed into the initial callback from `pc.script.create`. 

<h3 id="depot">Depot</h3>
A Depot is a collection of Entities, Assets and Code for a single user. Whilst usually a single Depot will only contain resources for a single application, you may use multiple Depots
as part of a single application. For example, each user on your team might have a separate depot containing your application resources and then you have a single Depot which represents
the shipping version of the application. This is analogous to how repositories or branches work in version control software. N.B. Moving Entities and Assets between Depots is a 
feature coming soon.

<h3 id="dom">DOM</h3>
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a way of representing an HTML document. Web browsers make an interface available for querying and modifying the DOM that makes up the HTML page that 
is displayed in the users browser.

<h3 id="entity">Entity</h3>
An Entity is the one of the building blocks of your application in the [PlayCanvas Engine](#engine). Often an Entity will represent a single object in your game or application,
though a single object may also be made of of multiple Entities. 

All Entities are have a transform matrix to provide their position and orientation; 
a parent Node from which they inherit a transform, and they can can optionally have child Nodes to which they supply their transform.   

<h3 id="framework">Framework</h3>
The Framework is the upper layer of abstraction in the PlayCanvas Engine. It consists of high-level features such as the Entity-Component System and the interface with the PlayCanvas Designer.
See the [Engine Overview][engine_overview] for more details on how the PlayCanvas Engine is structured.

<h3 id="gizmo">Gizmo</h3>
A Gizmo is a control that dragged around with the mouse in order to edit the attributes of an Entity, it is usually used to edit the transform matrix. A Gizmo consists of 
three color-coded parts, one for each axis in 3D space. Red is the X-axis, green is the Y-axis and blue is the Z-axis. Sometimes there will also be controls for manipulating 
more than one axis at once, e.g. X and Y, Y and Z, Z and X.

<h3 id="transform">Transformation Matrix</h3>
A Transformation Matrix is a mathematical matrix that represents a set of linear transforms. In particular translation, rotation and scale. This means that a transformation matrix
can be used to represent the position, orientation and size of an object in 3D space. In the PlayCanvas Engine each [Entity](#entity) has a transformation matrix accessible via the
`getLocalTransform()` and `setLocalTransform()` methods.

<h3 id="pack">Pack</h3>
A Pack is a collection of Entity data, Art data and Code data which can be loaded as a unit. A Pack may represent your entire game, or just a single level or part of your game.
A Pack is defined by creating an Entity that has a Pack Component. When you create a new Pack in the [PlayCanvas Designer](#designer) the root of the tree visible in the [Pack Explorer](#explorer)
is an Entity with a Pack Component.

<h3 id="designer">PlayCanvas Designer</h3>
The PlayCanvas Designer is a visual editing tool which can be used by members of your development team to edit [Packs](#pack). The PlayCanvas Designer is used to manipulate [Entities](#entity) 

<h3 id="engine">PlayCanvas Engine</h3>
The PlayCanvas Engine is a javascript library which provides all the functionality you will need to create an interactive 3D application or game. 
Programs created using the PlayCanvas Engine will run directly in a modern web browser with no need for third-party plugins.
