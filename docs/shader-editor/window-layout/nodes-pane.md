![Nodes Pane][1]

The Nodes Pane lists the built-in nodes available for constructing graphs. Nodes are grouped into sub-sections by category.

At the top of the pane are controls for filtering the list of nodes:

| Control | Use |
|---|---|
| I | Toggle to show only input nodes. |
| X | Toggle to show only transform nodes. |
| O | Toggle to show only output nodes.
| Filter Entry | Filter the list of nodes further by name. |

For more information on using the Nodes Pane to create nodes, see the [Graph Editor][2] documentation.
