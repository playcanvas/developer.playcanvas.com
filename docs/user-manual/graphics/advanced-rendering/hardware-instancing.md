Hardware instancing is a rendering technique which allows the GPU to render multiple identical meshes in a small number of draw calls. Each instance of the mesh can have a different limited amount of state (for example, position or color). It's a technique suitable to drawing objects such as trees or bullets, say.

For its support on a device, check `pc.GraphicsDevice.supportsInstancing`. In general, it is supported on all WebGL2 devices and also on the majority of WebGL1 devices using the ANGLE_instanced_arrays extension.

Note that all instances are submitted for rendering by the GPU with no camera frustum culling taking place.

## How to use instancing

Populate a vertex buffer with per instance matrices to provide their world matrices for rendering.

```javascript
// store matrices for individual instances into array
const matrices = new Float32Array(instanceCount * 16);
const matrix = new pc.Mat4();
let matrixIndex = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < instanceCount; i++) {
    matrix.setTRS(pos, pc.Vec3.ZERO, pc.Vec3.ONE);

    // copy matrix elements into array of floats
    for (let m = 0; m < 16; m++)
        matrices[matrixIndex++] = matrix.data[m];
}
```

Create a VertexBuffer which stores per-instance state and initialize it with the matrices. In the following example, we use [`pc.VertexFormat.getDefaultInstancingFormat`](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/VertexFormat.html#getDefaultInstancingFormat) which allows us to store a per-instance Mat4 matrix. Then we enable instancing on a MeshInstance, which contains the mesh geometry we want to instance.

```javascript
const instanceCount = 10;
const vertexBuffer = new pc.VertexBuffer(
    this.app.graphicsDevice,
    pc.VertexFormat.getDefaultInstancingFormat(this.app.graphicsDevice),
    instanceCount,
    pc.BUFFER_STATIC,
    matrices
);
meshInst.setInstancing(vertexBuffer);
```

Note, that you can create a dynamic vertex buffer using pc.BUFFER_DYNAMIC, and update the contents of it per-frame like this:

```javascript
vertexBuffer.setData(matrices);
```

## Custom shader

When you write custom shader that uses instancing, you need to read and use per-instance state from vertex attributes. In the following example, we read a `mat4` using vertex attributes.

```glsl
attribute vec4 instance_line1;
attribute vec4 instance_line2;
attribute vec4 instance_line3;
attribute vec4 instance_line4;

mat4 getModelMatrix() {
    return mat4(instance_line1, instance_line2, instance_line3, instance_line4);
}
```
