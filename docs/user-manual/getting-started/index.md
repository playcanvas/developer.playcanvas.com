## What is PlayCanvas?

PlayCanvas is a visual development platform for interactive web content. Both the tools and the web apps you build are powered by HTML5. The platform is web hosted so there's nothing to install and you can access your work from any device that runs one of the supported web browsers.

## Key Features

### Editor

The PlayCanvas Editor is a visual editing tool that lets you build scenes, applications and games in record time. Use the Editor to manage your project assets, to add interactivity and to communicate and work with your team. The Editor is collaborative in real-time which means you can immediately see changes made by your team and you can build and test your application across all devices instantly
