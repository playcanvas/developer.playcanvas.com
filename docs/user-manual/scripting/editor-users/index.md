This section focuses on the Editor-specific features and best practices that will enhance your scripting experience. Whether you're writing your first line of code or you're a seasoned developer, understanding these tools will significantly boost your productivity.

## Why This Section is Important for Editor Users

As an Editor user, you benefit from a tightly integrated development environment. This means:

* **Direct Asset Management:** Scripts are assets, managed alongside your models, textures, and materials.
* **Visual Configuration:** Script Attributes allow for easy, code-free customization of script behavior directly in the Inspector.
* **Rapid Iteration:** Features like Hot Reloading let you see changes in real-time.
* **Seamless Integration:** The Editor bridges the gap between your code and your scene, making it easy to connect scripts to Entities and Components.
