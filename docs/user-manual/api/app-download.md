## Route URL

```none
POST https://playcanvas.com/api/apps/download
```

## Description

This will allow you to download an app which you can self host on your own server. The request will start an export job and the job details will be returned in the response. You can [poll the job by id][2] until its status is either 'complete' or 'error'.

When the job is complete, the data on ["Get job"][2] will contain a `data.download_url` string property to download the exported app.

## Example

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"project_id": 9999999, "scenes": [9999999], "name": "My App"}' "https://playcanvas.com/api/apps/download"
```
