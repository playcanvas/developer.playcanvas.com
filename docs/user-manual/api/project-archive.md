title: Projects - Archive project

## Route URL

```none
POST https://playcanvas.com/api/projects/:id/export
```

## Description

This will allow you to download a zip archive of your entire project. You can import that archive from your Projects Dashboard to create a new Project from that archive. More about importing projects [here][3].

The request will start an archive job and the job details will be returned in the response. You can [poll the job by id][2] until its status is either 'complete' or 'error'. When the job is done, its data will contain a URL to download the project archive.

## Example

```none
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"branch_id": "99999999-9999-9999-9999-999999999999"}' "https://playcanvas.com/api/projects/{projectId}/export"
```
