The user can interact with [Element][1] components, by enabling the `useInput` field on the Element component:

![Use Input](/img/user-manual/assets/fonts/use-input.png)

Also in order for that to work there must be an initialized instance of `pc.ElementInput` for `pc.Application#elementInput`. This is created automatically for you if you are using the Editor. If you are using the Engine only make sure to create an instance *before* the other input devices like `pc.Mouse` or `pc.TouchDevice` like so:

```javascript
const app = new pc.Application(canvas, {
    elementInput: new pc.ElementInput(canvas),
    mouse: new pc.Mouse(canvas),
    touch: !!('ontouchstart' in window) ? new pc.TouchDevice(canvas) : null,
    keyboard: new pc.Keyboard(window),
    gamepads: new pc.GamePads(),
    ...
});
```

## Input Events

When you enable input on an Element component the following events will be fired:

### mousedown

Fired when the mouse is pressed while the mouse cursor is on the component.

### mouseup

Fired when the mouse is released while the mouse cursor is on the component.

### mouseenter

Fired when the mouse cursor enters the component.

### mouseleave

Fired when the mouse cursor leaves the component.

### mousemove

Fired when the mouse cursor is moved on the component.

### mousewheel

Fired when the mouse wheel is scrolled on the component.

### click

Fired when the mouse is pressed and released on the component or when a touch starts and ends on the component.

### touchstart

Fired when a touch starts on the component.

### touchend

Fired when a touch ends on the component.

### touchmove

Fired when a touch moves after it started touching the component.

### touchcancel

Fired when a touch is cancelled on the component.

## Event Handling

To handle an input event you can listen for it on the Element component:

```javascript
this.entity.element.on('click', function (event) {
    console.log('The element ' + event.element.entity.name + ' was clicked.');
}, this);
```

## Event bubbling

When an input event is fired on an Element component it bubbles up to its parent Elements unless you call `event.stopPropagation()`. For example:

```javascript
this.entity.element.on('click', function (event) {
    // stop bubbling
    event.stopPropagation();

    console.log('The element ' + event.element.entity.name + ' was clicked.');
}, this);
```

Calling `stopPropagation` will also stop the event from being handled by the other input devices like `pc.Mouse` or `pc.TouchDevice`. So if for example you are handling mouse input using `app.mouse.wasPressed`, you can call `stopPropagation` on the `mousedown` event to prevent `app.mouse.wasPressed` from returning true. For example:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs defaultValue="classic" groupId='script-code'>
<TabItem  value="esm" label="ESM">

```javascript
import { ScriptType, MOUSEBUTTON_LEFT } from 'playcanvas';

export class InputScript extends Script {
    initialize() {
        this.entity.element.on('mousedown', (evt) => {
            evt.stopPropagation();
        }, this);
    }

    update(dt) {
        if (this.app.mouse.wasPressed(MOUSEBUTTON_LEFT)) {
            // do something when the left button was pressed.
            // this will not be called if the button was pressed on the Element
            // because we call stopPropagation
        }
    }
}

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="classic" label="Classic">

```javascript
var InputScript = pc.createScript('inputScript');

InputScript.prototype.initialize = function () {
    this.entity.element.on('mousedown', function (evt) {
        evt.stopPropagation();
    }, this);
},

InputScript.prototype.update = function (dt) {
    if (this.app.mouse.wasPressed(pc.MOUSEBUTTON_LEFT)) {
        // do something when the left button was pressed.
        // this will not be called if the button was pressed on the Element
        // because we call stopPropagation
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Mouse and Touch event conflict on Google Chrome

Google Chrome simulates mouse events also on touch devices. By doing so it could cause some unexpected behavior. For example if you hide a button right after the click event, another UI element that lays behind it could also receive an unwanted click event.

To prevent this behavior you can call the ```preventDefault()``` method of the native event object on the ```pc.EVENT_TOUCHEND``` event:

Here is small script to include once in your scene:

<Tabs defaultValue="classic" groupId='script-code'>
<TabItem  value="esm" label="ESM">

```javascript
import { ScriptType, EVENT_TOUCHEND } from 'playcanvas';

export class TouchFix extends Script {
    initialize () {
        // Only register touch events if the device supports touch
        const touch = this.app.touch;
        if (touch) {
            touch.on(EVENT_TOUCHEND, function(event) {
                // This prevents that a mouse click event will be executed after a touch event.
                event.event.preventDefault();
            });
        }
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="classic" label="Classic">

```javascript
var TouchFix = pc.createScript('touchFix');

// initialize code called once per entity
TouchFix.prototype.initialize = function() {
    // Only register touch events if the device supports touch
    const touch = this.app.touch;
    if (touch) {
        touch.on(pc.EVENT_TOUCHEND, function(event) {
            // This prevents that a mouse click event will be executed after a touch event.
            event.event.preventDefault();
        });
    }
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
