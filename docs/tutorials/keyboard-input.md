*Click to focus, then press `left arrow`, `right arrow` and `spacebar` to rotate the cube. Press and release the 'a' key to change color.*

Keyboard handling in the PlayCanvas engine is provided by the `pc.Keyboard` object. The Keyboard object provides a simple interface
for common keyboard operations like checking if a key is pressed or held down. It also takes away the various cross-browser problems with
handling keycodes and charcodes.

Take a look at the keyboard input Scene in the [tutorials project][1]. Here is the code for the tutorial:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs defaultValue="classic" groupId='script-code'>

```javascript
import { ScriptType, KEY_LEFT, KEY_RIGHT, KEY_SPACE, KEY_A } from 'playcanvas';

export class KeyboardHandler extends Script {
    static attributes = {
        redMaterial: {
            type: 'asset',
            assetType: 'material'
        },
        whiteMaterial: {
            type: 'asset',
            assetType: 'material'
        }
    };

    // initialize code called once per entity
    initialize() {
        // Use on() to listen for events on the keyboard device.
        // Arguments are:
        // 1) The event name to listen for
        // 2) The callback function to call when the event fires
        // 3) (optional) The value to use for 'this' in the callback function

        this.app.keyboard.on("keydown", this.onKeyDown, this);
        this.app.keyboard.on("keyup", this.onKeyUp, this);
    }

    // update code called every frame
    update(dt) {
        /*

         * make the block spin. wasPressed() is used to detect a

        var angle = 0;
        if (this.app.keyboard.wasPressed(KEY_LEFT)) {
            angle = -5;
        } else if (this.app.keyboard.wasPressed(KEY_RIGHT)) {
            angle = 5;
        }

There are two ways of detecting keyboard input. The first is done in the update method of your scripts. Use `isPressed()` and `wasPressed()` and check whether a key is currently pressed or has just been pressed. The second uses events to respond to a key press or release as it happens.

## `isPressed` vs `wasPressed`

In the demo above you can see the difference in behavior between `isPressed()` and `wasPressed()`.

When you press and hold the left or right arrow keys the cube will rotate by 5&deg;, but it will only rotate once. This is because `wasPressed()` only returns true for the frame immediately after the key was pressed.

If you press and hold the spacebar you will see that the cube rotates continuously by 1&deg; per frame. This is because `isPressed()` returns true for every frame in which the key is pressed.

### `isPressed(key)`

`isPressed(key)` checks to see if `key` is currently pressed and returns true if it is. It will return true for every frame while the key is pressed.

### `wasPressed(key)`

`wasPressed(key)` checks to see if `key` was pressed *since the last frame*. `wasPressed()` will only return true once for a single key press.

## Events

The second method of handling key presses is to listen for events. Two keyboard events are supported on the Keyboard device:

* `pc.EVENT_KEYDOWN`
* `pc.EVENT_KEYUP`

[DOM][3] keyboard events are implemented differently on different browsers so the PlayCanvas Engine provides events on the `pc.Keyboard` object so you can use the same code everywhere. When the keyboard events are fired the event handler is passed a `pc.KeyboardEvent` object which contains the key code of the key that was pressed on released.

Notice we are also passing a third argument to on(), which is `this` or the Script Instance itself. The third argument to on() is used as `this` in the event callbacks, so we need to pass it in here, otherwise it won't be set to the correct object.

## Key Codes

Identifying which key is pressed is done using key codes. These are numerical values which match up to a key on the keyboard. For example, pc.KEY_A is the `A` key, pc.KEY_LEFT is the left arrow key.

Note, you should always use the enumeration `pc.KEY_*` rather than using numerical values. As the actual value of these constants may change in the future.

## Try it out

Try it out in full screen [here][2] or at the top of the page. Compare tapping and holding the arrow keys, and tapping and holding the spacebar.
